SIMPLE SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORK

What is this?
	This is a simple social media network that I created during high school as part of my advanced higher computer science assignment in 2019. 
	As of 22/09/2021 on firefox 92.0, a lot of the intended functionality is no longer functioning. It was created for Google Chrome (unknown version from 2019), Windows 10.
	Listed below is what I found to be working currently.

What you can do:
	Create a profile
	Login to said profile
	Access the home page
	Create posts that others can see
	Sort posts on the home page by new and old
	Search for user profiles
	Look at a user's profile and see what they have posted
	Log out of a user profile
	Delete a user profile

How can I run it for myself?
	EasyPHP-DevServer-14.1VC11 is required in order to get the website to load and to show its intended features. 
	I managed to do so by having the project folder and the EasyPHP folder in the same directory, running EasyPHP, 
	then opening localweb by right clicking EasyPHP in the system tray.
	Using the website is somewhat intuitive. The actual webpages don't seem to have dealt well with time, 
	so you will need to use horizontal scroll to see stuff like the sort buttons and the user profile. 
	You can see user options by clicking on the blank profile picture on the top right of the webpage after logging in.
